# > A resource type's check script is invoked to detect new versions of the
# > resource. It is given the configured source and current version on stdin, and
# > must print the array of new versions, in chronological order, to stdout,
# > including the requested version if it's still valid.

# Specifically, this script should:
#
# 1) Parse the name of the task definition from the input given on STDIN
# 2) Parse the current version from the task definition given on STDIN
# 3) Find any newer versions of the task definition using the AWS CLI
# 4) Output a list of all of the new versions
